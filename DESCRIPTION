Title: Slope Determination by Analysis of Residuals
Version: 0.1.3
Author: Robert Wendlandt
Maintainer: Robert Wendlandt <robert.wendlandt@uksh.de>
Description: Implementation of the SDAR algorithm for Slope Determination by 
    Analysis of Residuals as standardized in ASTM E3076-18. 
    It allows for automated and objective linear-fitting of mechanical test-data. 
    As the algorithm heavily uses linear regressions, a faster version is 
    also available to find the optimum region for linear fitting by random
    sub-sampling.
