# sdarr

The sdarr-package provides a R implementation of the SDAR algorithm for
Slope Determination by Analysis of Residuals as standardized in [ASTM
E3076-18](https://doi.org/10.1520/E3076-18).  
It allows for automated and objective linear-fitting of mechanical
test-data. See a detailed description of the original algorithm in the
[NIST Technical Note 2050 by E.
Lucon](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2050).

As the original algorithm heavily uses linear regressions, a faster
version was implemented here, which finds the optimum region for linear
fitting by random sub-sampling.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sdarr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("soylentOrange/sdarr")
```

## Example

Basic example of the sdarr-function on a synthetic data set. The
synthetic data set is based on the properties of aluminium (Al 6060 T66)
as given in the [Metallic Material Properties Development and
Standardization (MMPDS)
Handbook](https://ntrl.ntis.gov/NTRL/dashboard/searchResults/titleDetail/PB2003106632.xhtml).
A toe-region and a non-zero intercept are added to make the test data
less boring.

The sdarr-function analyzes the data and wil give a small report as a
message. It should confirm the Youngâ€™s-modulus of 68 GPa and an
intercept of 10 MPa.

``` r
library(sdarr)
# Synthesize a test record resembling Al 6060 T66
# (Values from MMPDS Handbook, with a toe region added)
Al_6060_T66 <- synthesize_test_data(slope = 68000, yield.y = 160, 
                                    ultimate.y = 215, ultimate.x = 0.091,
                                    offset = 10,
                                    toe.initial.y = 3, toe.max.y = 15,
                                    toe.initial.slope = 34000)

# Analyze the test record
Al_6060_T66.result <- sdarr(Al_6060_T66, x = strain, y = stress, 
                            verbose = "r", showPlots = "r")
