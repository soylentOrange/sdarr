Description: Slope Determination by Analysis of Residuals (SDAR) for automated 
    and objective linear-fitting of mechanical test-data as standardized in 
    "ASTM E3076-18" <doi:10.1520/E3076-18>. A random sub-sampling modification 
    of the SDAR algorithm is additionally implemented to improve processing 
    speed.
